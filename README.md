# Asymptotically Efficient Quantum Karatsuba Multiplication

This is the latex source for my paper "Asymptotically Efficient Quantum Karatsuba Multiplication"
available at (NOT YET RELEASED).

The easiest way to build the pdf is to dump the repo contents into an overleaf.com project.

Also included, in the ancillary `anc/` directory, are python and Q# implementations of the construction.
