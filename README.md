# Asymptotically Efficient Quantum Karatsuba Multiplication

This is the latex source for my paper "Asymptotically Efficient Quantum Karatsuba Multiplication"
available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07356 .

The easiest way to build the pdf is to dump the repo contents into an overleaf.com project.

Also included, in the ancillary `anc/` directory, are python and Q# implementations of the construction.
